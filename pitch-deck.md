# **Craig the Compliance Manager**

### Making Compliance Simple, Automated, and Stress-Free

---

## The Problem 😰

- **Compliance is overwhelming** - regulations constantly change
- **Manual tracking is time-consuming** - spreadsheets and documentation everywhere
- **Missed deadlines are costly** - penalties, audits, and reputation damage
- **Small teams can't keep up** - dedicated compliance officers are expensive
- **Regulatory burden is growing** - GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and more

> *Companies spend an average of $5.5M annually on compliance, yet 47% still fail audits*
